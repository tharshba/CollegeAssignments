My name is Kameron Maclin. I am currently a senior at UTK majoring in Computer Science. I am mostly interested in the aspects of software engineering.
I was a UT cheerleader for two years, then I decided to let go of the sport in order to focus more of my studies and my future. Overall, I am very interested and excited 
to see what this class has to offer.
