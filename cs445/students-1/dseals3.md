Hello there, I am Damian Seals, and I am in my last semester here at UTK before I get my Masters in Comp Sci. My hobbies include making Youtube videos, playing my guitar, going on dates, planting trees (I have around 20 on my apartment's balcony right now), and working out. As for what I'd like to get out of the course, just some new knowledge. A friend of mine recommended I take this class so I'm open to really anything that comes my way. Thanks!
