My name is Anderson Walsh. I am a senior studying computer science with a minor in machine learning. In the past, I have worked for Samsung Austin Semiconductor on Android emulations for GPU hardware/firmware testing. Currently, I work for a startup primarily doing full stack web development in the healthcare sector. This work has me interested in handling medical data for diagnostic/predictive purposes. In this course, I hope to learn concepts and skills that will broaden my understanding of and proficiency with handling, manipulating, or interpreting data.
