I am Charles Wang and I am a student in the Computer Science department at the Tickle college of engineering. I am always interested in programing and its applications
and I have applied that while working on my hobbies. I like to find things that seem difficult and try to learn them to make them seem more simple that they first appear
to be. I like to play video games and sports.
