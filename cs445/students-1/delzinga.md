I am David Elzinga and I am a fifth year PhD student in the Mathematics Department and am concurrently getting a MS in Statistics. My research and industry experience is in mathematical and statistical modeling natural resource management and ecological conservation strategies. I enjoy hiking, swimming, board games, cooking, and making mathematical/statistical models! I look forward to understanding how to collect data for, and design/maintain pipelines for these models.
