I am Josh Mandzak and I am a graduate student pursuing my MS here at UTK. I received my BS in CS from UTK last may, and participated in the 5 year MS/BS program. I've had a few internships, the last two of which were both with Garmin as an embedded software engineer. I've grown more interested in machine learning and data analysis/science the past few years, and am hoping to learn useful techniques in this class concerning discovering and managing large amounts of data.
