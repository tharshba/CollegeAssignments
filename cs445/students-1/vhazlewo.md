I am Victor Hazlewood

Victor Hazlewood is the Director of High Performance & Scientific Computing at UTK and I am also a Certified Security Professional with a CISSP.  I have worked in a varity of areas of information technology and high performance computing systems at Texas A&M, University of California San Diego, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and now at University of Tennessee, Knoxville.     I am working on my Masters and trying to get obtain a breadth of understanding in security, data analytics, and areas of growth in UTK research computing which includes ML/AI and bioinformatics.  

I am interested in learning and understanding more about data science and work towards providing the capabilities for UT researchers. Data that I am interested in would be genetics, genomics data, ML/AI data as relates to security (app logs, job logs, IP packet captures, etc) and one other would be analysis of datasets on file systems to identify data that is no longer actively used and could be migrated especially from users with massive amounts of data.
