Hi, my name is Ashley Babjac and I am a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science. My research mostly focuses on machine and deep learning applications to genomics or ecological domains. I am taking this class to better understand big data workflows and apply them to some of my more recent projects involving deep learning and NLP.
