I am Robert Williams and I am a senior in computer engineering. I am in the 5-Year MS/BS program, so this course counts for both undergraduate and graduate credit. I am also currently an intern at TVA and am working in a data analytics role, so I thought that this course would complement my work there. I am interested in renewable energy and electric vehicles as well as video games, so I would be most interested in doing a project based on one of those things, but I also work in business analytics so that would be helpful too.
