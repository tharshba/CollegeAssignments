I am Nima Tayefeh, and I am a current senior studying computer science. I am also pursuing a cybersecurity minor. In relation to computer science, I enjoy working with AI, embedded systems, and data analysis.
Outside of technology, I do a lot of photography and art on the side. I also spend a lot of time trying to make new recipes from different cuisines. 
Through this class, I hope to gain a better understanding of data analysis and working with a team environment
