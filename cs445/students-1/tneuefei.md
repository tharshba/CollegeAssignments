I am Thomas Neuefeind and I am a senior in Computer Science. I have a prior BA in Psychology, with a minor in Neuroscience. Currently I work on neuromorphic computing
in the TENN Lab here at UT. I really enjoy that work and hope to work on something similar as a career. Apart from school and work, I also love to play soccer, walk my dog, 
spend time with my wife, and occasionally play videogames when I get the chance.
