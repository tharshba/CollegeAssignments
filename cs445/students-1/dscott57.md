I am Danny Scott. I am a graduate student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, persuing a PhD in Computer Science, Data Analytics.  I work at Oak Ridge Associated Universities as a Data Warehouse Analyst and manage ETL pipelines.  I have a masters in Data Analytics from the University of Maryland where I nurtured a passion for data science.  I have used python for two data science projects; one project centerd in NLP and the other in image segmentation.  I use jupyter quite often to test and create POC code for various problems that come up in my job.
