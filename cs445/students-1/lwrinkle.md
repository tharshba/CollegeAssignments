My name is Logan Wrinkle and I've yet to really find a subfield of computer science that really grasps me. Some noteable things I've done include 3 years of robotics, building and programming an arcade cabinet from scratch, teaching K-12 programming, and working on a small handful of short arcade style games using python, Godot, and C#. More than anything else I want to broaden my horizons with this class and maybe gain a new perspective on programming.
