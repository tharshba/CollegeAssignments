I am Ria Patel and I am a senior in Computer Science. I am interested in reproducibility and machine learning using high-performance computing resources. 
I deal with a lot of data and would love to learn different techniques related to dealing with big data. I would also love to learn about how to see 
different problems and solutions that use the data.
