My name is John Sadik. I am currently a master's student at UTK with a concentration in cybersecurity. My interests are mostly in usable security and human factors in cybersecurity. From this course I want to learn what digital archeology is and how it is used in the field/industry. I am also interested in any connections it has with cybersecurity. Also I heard docker was used in this class before and I am interested in learning how to use that.
