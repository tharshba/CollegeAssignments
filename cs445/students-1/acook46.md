Hi, my name is Adam Cook, and I am a Master's student at the University of Tennessee for Computer Science. My interests in the field are mostly around machine learning and artificial intelligence, although I have some experience in web development and virtual reality. I hope that this course can help foster new skills towards machine learning as data curation is not a technique I am very familiar with.
