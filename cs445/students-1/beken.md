I'm Burcum Eken. I graduated from Gazi University in Turkey. I'm graduate student at Computer Science. 
My major is Cyber Security but I'm ML, Data Science enthusiast, -specifically application security and computer vision-. 
Iâ€™d like to improve statical analysis, processing large data sets and data visualization skills. Hopefully, everything goes well!
