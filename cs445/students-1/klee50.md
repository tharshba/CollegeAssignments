## Karen Hughes - klee50

I am Karen Hughes, and I am pursing a Master's in Computer Science. I'm a GTA for the EECS department and work part-time as a software engineering intern. I enjoy solving problems and working in web development, especially seeing my work reflected via front-end. My hobbies include traveling, reading, and playing board games. I would like to understand new ways to collect and analyze relevant data in order to utilize these skills for future projects.
