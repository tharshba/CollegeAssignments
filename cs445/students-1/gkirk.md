Hi, my name is Grayson Kirk and I am a Dual MBA- MS Electrical Engineering student. I received my BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tennessee in 2019. I have finished the majority of my business courses and am looking forward to getting back into the engineering portion of my degree! My professional interests include business focused data analytics including predictive and prescriptive forecasting. In my free time I like to play drums, go on a hike, read, and travel. I look forward to adding more skills to my data mining tool belt and learning the ancillary tools that the class will use.
